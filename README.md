# Wrapper: Offline
After the announcement that GoAnimate Wrapper (a project by VisualPlugin/Windows81) would be shut down, Wrapper: Offline was created. Unlike the original project, Wrapper: Offline can not be shut down. You have the files all on your computer. This project is important for historical and archival purposes, as the ability to use this legacy editor and themes would be completely gone without it. Besides simply emulating the original Flash editor, Wrapper also adds some additional features, such as additional poses for Comedy World characters. And Wrapper: Offline will soon add additional things too in a future update.

## Running / Installation
To start Wrapper on Windows, open start_wrapper.bat. It'll automate most steps for you, maybe ask a question or two when starting it for the first time, and start Wrapper.
On your first run, you will likely need to right-click it and click "Run as Administrator". This allows it to properly install what it needs to run. After your initial run, you shouldn't need to do that again, you can start it as normal.
If you want to import videos and characters from the original Wrapper, open its folder and drag the _SAVED folder into Wrapper: Offline's "wrapper" folder. If you have already made any videos or characters, this will not work. Please only import on a clean install, or take the _SAVED folder in Offline out before dragging the old one in.

## Troubleshooting
This project has been tested on Windows 10 Version 1909 with Chrome and Firefox. Linux support is coming soon. I do not have a Mac computer to test and configure for, but it should still be possible to run if you set up manually. Almost all browsers (as of writing) are based on Chrome or Firefox, so if you're using another browser, it should still work fine.

Flash Player (the program the editor and player run on) support ends at the end of 2020. If this date has already passed, it may be very hard to run Wrapper, as browsers remove support for Flash completely. I would recommend looking into projects like [Lightspark](http://lightspark.github.io/) and [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) that are attempting to recreate Flash. If neither of these projects are able to run Wrapper properly, you can edit settings.bat and use the included version of ungoogled-chromium.

If you're running 32-bit Linux, you will not be able to install Node.js. An older version that supports 32-bit *may* work, but this is untested.

If attempting to visit the hosted server at <https://127.0.0.1:4343>, Firefox will stop you from visiting, saying that the HTTPS certificate is untrusted because it is self-signed. There is no away around this, and it is not a concern beyond potential annoyance, as nobody besides you can access it. If you see a notice like this on a real website, *that* is a cause for concern, but you're just connecting to yourself. Besides, there is little reason to visit the server pages directly except development.

If you're getting errors that prevent Node.js or http-servers from running, they may have updated in a way that breaks Wrapper. Run resetdependancies.bat, and it will replace the installed versions with the included versions that are tested and known to work. This is not recommended unless you are sure the latest versions are causing problems. If you know what version caused this issue, you should install the latest version that works instead.

If your issue is not listed here, look at the next section.

## Dependencies
This program relies on Flash, Node.js and http-server to work properly. They have been included with the project (utilities folder) to ensure full offline operation and will be installed if missing, but you are given the option to check for the latest versions. The "wrapper" folder and http-server have their own dependencies, but they are included.

## License
Most of this project is free/libre software[1] under the MIT license. You have the freedom to run, change, and share this as much as you want.
This includes:
  - Files in the "wrapper" folder
  - Batch files made for Wrapper: Offline
  - Node.js
  - http-server

ungoogled-chromium is under the BSD 3-Clause license, which grants similar rights, but has some differences from MIT. If you wish to see these differences, compare the LICENSE file in the base wrapper-offline folder and the LICENSE file in utilities/ungoogled-chromium.

Flash Player (utilities folder) and GoAnimate's original assets (server folder) are proprietary and do not grant you these rights, but if they did, this project wouldn't need to exist.

While completely unnecessary, if you decide to use your freedom to change the software, it would be greatly appreciated if you sent it to me so I can implement it into the main program! With credit down here of course :)
